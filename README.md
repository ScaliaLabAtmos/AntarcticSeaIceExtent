# Antarctic Sea Ice Reconstructions

This is a repository for the code and data used in Fogt et al. (2021), **A Regime Shift in Seasonal Total Antarctic Sea Ice Extent in the 20th Century**, to appear in *Nature Climate Change*.

It contains the data associated with reconstructions of Antarctic sea ice extent (monthly and seasonal) and the Antarctic sea ice concentration (seasonal).

The data is organized into folders:

 * [Seasonal observations](seasonal/observations)
 * [Seasonal Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Reconstruction (text files)](seasonal/ensembles_text)
 * [Seasonal Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Reconstruction (netcdf files)](seasonal/ensembles_netcdf)
 * [Seasonal Best Fit, Ensemble Mean Seasonal Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Reconstructions (text files)](seasonal/best_fit_text)
 * [Seasonal Best Fit, Ensemble Mean Seasonal Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Reconstructions (netcdf files)](seasonal/best_fit_netcdf)
 * [Figure Code from Fogt et al. (2021) (NCL)](seasonal/code_for_repository)
